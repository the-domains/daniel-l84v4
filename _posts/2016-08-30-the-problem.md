## The Problem

Due to overlying muscles, sensitive tissues, saliva gland and the small bone size, current plate and screw based implants are difficult and dangerous to use. Our client seeks a design that reduces the fracture and immobilizes it for the 6-8 month healing process.

## Condylar Fractures

About 30% of mandibular fractures occur in the condylar process. Any damage to the mandible's unique anatomy of results in pain, deformity and jaw dysfunction. Dr. David Naysmith, a plastic surgeon and our client, sees around 30 cases each year, of which less than half are operable with current methods.

## Design Criteria

* Reduce the variables during surgery
* Reduce the surgery time, patient is anesthetized
* Immobilize the fracture from micromovements
* Biocompatible implant material
* Everything must fit in 1 centimeter surgical cavity
* Simple and convenient insertion
