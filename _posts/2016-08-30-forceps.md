Forceps

Key aspects of the surgical procedure were observed in person during a visit to the Island Medical Program's cadaver lab. The surgeon demonstrated accessing and fixing the fracture using hand tools. It was there that the spatial restrictions and anatomical challenges faced during surgery were fully realized. A modified set of forceps began to take conceptual shape, and later it became a heavily modified version of Kelly forceps.

Our modifications included extending the arms beyond the hinge, enabling convenient reduction of a completely fractured condyle neck and tension banded condyle head. An temporary immobilizing attachment was developed to keep the fracture reduced during fixation. A 1.2 centimeter space between the arms allows room to â€‹enable permanent fixation.
