# Forceps

Key aspects of the surgical procedure were observed in person during a visit to the Island Medical Program's cadaver lab. The surgeon demonstrated accessing and fixing the fracture using hand tools. It was there that the spatial restrictions and anatomical challenges faced during surgery were fully realized. A modified set of forceps began to take conceptual shape, and later it became a heavily modified version of Kelly forceps.

Our modifications included extending the arms beyond the hinge, enabling convenient reduction of a completely fractured condyle neck and tension banded condyle head. An temporary immobilizing attachment was developed to keep the fracture reduced during fixation. A 1.2 centimeter space between the arms allows room to ​enable permanent fixation.

## **Design Features**

​

### Material

Medical devices must meet extremely stringent design and fabrication criteria. Stainless steel is the most suitable material for medical grade forceps due to its high corrosion resistance, strength, durability and sterility.

### ​Arms

The forcep arms are elongated and widened at the ends, enabling the surgeon to grasp the fracture's distal end and maneuver it to the correct position for reduction and fixation.

### Ratcheting Handle

This feature of the Kelly forceps was kept since the ratchet handle maintains a constant tip pressure, clamping the floating bone for further manipulation.

Cost Assessment

ProtoLabs supplied a quote for a laser sintered (additive manufacturing) prototype. A single forcep arm exceeded $300\. Further development requires working with a manufacturer to alter the design in order to ease manufacturing and reduce cost.

Immobilization Attachment

The forceps are designed to mate with the immobilization attachment, shown below, which the surgeon slides into place after reducing the fracture. After it is attached to the forceps, screws are used to slide the adjustable plate up to the jaw, fixing it in place. This added feature eliminates variables by keeping the fracture reduced, enabling operation with both hands and fewer obstructions.
