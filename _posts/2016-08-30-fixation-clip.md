A novel fixation clip was developed in response to our client's suggestion about the problem solving potential for such a device. The cylindrical clip is opened and delivered using specialized, novel forceps. Post-installation it sharply grips the distal and proximal ends of the fracture. Engaging the tabs with a standard forcep creates a longitudinal forcing action, further pressuring the fracture together. Inspired in part by the Raney clip used to hold back the scalp during craniotomies, the clip is manufactured in the relaxed position.

Bone is a dynamic tissue and the implant will slowly, ever so slightly embed itself into the condylar neck's cortical perimeter. Osteocytes combined with osteoblast generated ECM solidifies alongside the textured teeth, preventing the clip from floating around after complete, primary bone healing.

# Design Features

## Material

Finite element analysis was used to assess different materials. Stainless steel provided the appropriate elastic properties for hinging of the device, and rigidity upon deployment. A titanium coating provides biocompatibility.

​​

## Clip Backing

Gaps allow for mating the clip with the installation forceps (not pictured). A circular cross section was selected to maximize the pressure transmitting down from the backing's apex.

​

## Central Teeth

The central teeth provide the rigidity to the fracture. They serve as the first contact point with the bone during device deployment, securing the proximal and distal ends firmly in place.

​

## End Teeth

​The teeth on either side of the central teeth are designed to provide an axial force which drives the bones together, enabling primary bone healing.

​​

## Cost Assessment

ProtoLabs supplied a quote to manufacture a prototype. A laser sintered life size stainless steel clip is $488\. This price for product development is acceptable, as the cost is marginally higher than screws and plates, and would decrease with mass production.

# Fused Deposition PLA Proof of Concept

A clip was manufactured using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid. Models of 3x scale were produced to investigate the devices functionality. One hundred percent fill density and 0.2 mm layers produced the strongest and most repeatable results. Seen below is a scaled up model, rigidly clamping a fractured piece of driftwood. Forcing the ends of the wood in all directions illustrated the clips rigidity.​
