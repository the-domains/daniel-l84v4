  A novel fixation clip was developed in response to our client's suggestion
  about the problem solving potential for such a device. The cylindrical clip is
  opened and delivered using specialized, novel forceps. Post-installation it
  sharply grips the distal and proximal ends of the fracture. Engaging the tabs
  with a standard forcep creates a longitudinal forcing action, further
  pressuring the fracture together. Inspired in part by the Raney clip used to
  hold back the scalp during craniotomies, the clip is manufactured in the
  relaxed position.

A novel fixation clip was developed in response to our client's suggestion about the problem solving potential for such a device. The cylindrical clip is opened and delivered using specialized, novel forceps. Post-installation it sharply grips the distal and proximal ends of the fracture. Engaging the tabs with a standard forcep creates a longitudinal forcing action, further pressuring the fracture together. Inspired in part by the Raney clip used to hold back the scalp during craniotomies, the clip is manufactured in the relaxed position.

Bone is a dynamic tissue and the implant will slowly, ever so slightly embed itself into the condylar neck's cortical perimeter. Osteocytes combined with osteoblast generated ECM solidifies alongside the textured teeth, preventing the clip from floating around after complete, primary bone healing.
